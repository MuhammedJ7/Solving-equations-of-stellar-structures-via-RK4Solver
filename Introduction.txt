Hello this will be an intro to how i did my third year project 
Title : Equations of Stellar Structures
Description : The objective of this project was to use Runge-Kutta methods to solve the spherically symetric equations of stellar Structure
describing newtonian stellar objects, such as white dwarfs (Lane-emden equation) or relatavistic objects, 
such as neutron stars (Tolman -Oppenheimer-volkoff equation), was given some guidance and tips on how to problem solve
specific instances dealing with relatavity
