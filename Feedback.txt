1st EXAMINER COMMENTS


For this project, the student was asked to investigate numerical methods for solving the equations of stellar structure 
governing white dwarves or neutron stars. The student was not familiar with general relativity, so he opted for the former, 
namely the Lane-Emden equation. 

The literature is reviewed relatively well, and there is a good attempt at physical explanation of the principles underlying 
the equations of stellar structure (for a student with a background in mathematics and not physics).

The student made a very nice and clear presentation at the School.


The coding/numerical aspect is also covered relatively well. The student implemented his own Runge-Kutta solver in Python. 
There is a missed opportunity to discuss numerical errors, e.g. by comparing to exact solutions, or performing convergence testing. 
This would have been useful for understanding numerical accuracy and validating the code.

The text could benefit from more detail. It does flow relatively well, but at points it appears patchy, with information assembled 
from different sources. The bibliography is well written and formatted, but it could sample more of the vast literature on the 
subject.

On balance, however, the project deserves upper 60’s or low 70’s.
My recommendation is 71/100.
